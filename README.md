# hello-world

As head of strategy and growth at Jungle.ai i'm starting my ML journey to increase my understanding of our products and services, and to support clients in problem formulation. I have a BSc in Aerospace Engineering and an MSc in Management of Technology, both completed at the Delft University of Technology. Moreover, I've completed all courses of an MSc in Mechanical Engineering (Transport Engineering & Logistics) to gain more insight in the design of logistic processes.
